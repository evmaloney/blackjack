## What is Blackjack?
**Blackjack** *(or 21)* is a card game, generally used to bet money or chips. Because it involves some strategy and provides some of the best odds among casino games, it is considered to be the most popular casino game in the world. The exact origin of the game is unkown but is believed to have been developed over time between Spain, England, and France during the 17th and 18th centuries. The idea of the game, put simply, is to get your hand closer to 21 than the dealer does without going over.
